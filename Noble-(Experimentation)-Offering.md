# Noble (Experimentation) Service

The Noble (Experimentation) service is designed to bridge the gap between the Experimentation Sandbox and production/operational stages of projects. It provides project owners with a dedicated space to learn how to transition their projects from the sandbox stage to a more production-ready state. The service offers an environment that combines the flexibility of experimentation with the added capabilities and guidelines necessary for a production-like setup.

## Features

- Budget Allocation: Each project within the service will have a dedicated budget of $2000 per year for resources and services.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Integration: Projects hosted in the service must be managed and deployed using Infrastructure as Code. A default IaC code repository will be provided for each project.
- Data Backup and Recovery: Users are required to implement their own backup and recovery solutions for their projects.
- Access and Permissions: IAM settings will be set at the GCP Project level. A user will be granted basic editor-level access, and further permission changes will be done through Infrastructure as Code.
- Connection to Legacy Datacenters: The Noble (Experimentation) service does not provide direct connections to legacy datacenters.
- Geographic Limitations: The service is limited to projects hosted in Canada.

## Benefits

- Enable project owners to explore and understand the requirements and demands of transitioning a project from experimentation to production.
- Provide a middle ground between pure experimentation and full-scale production, allowing for the exploration of technologies while adhering to organizational requirements.
- Facilitate learning and best practices for operationalizing projects by implementing recommended infrastructure and deployment practices.

## Use Cases / Playbooks

1. **Transitioning from Experimentation to Production**: Guide project owners through the process of transitioning their projects from the Experimentation Sandbox to a more production-ready state.
2. **Proof of Concept Validation**: Utilize the Noble (Experimentation) service as a dedicated space to validate proof of concept (POC) ideas and make informed decisions about proceeding with full-scale development.
3. **High Availability and Scalability Testing**: Test the performance, reliability, and scalability of applications by leveraging the resources and infrastructure capabilities of the Noble (Experimentation) service.

## Success Stories

- Currently no success stories available for the Noble (Experimentation) service.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Noble (Experimentation) service, project owners can follow these steps:

1. Contact the Public Health Data Center of Practice to request access and usage guidelines.
2. Familiarize yourself with the provided default IaC code repository and recommended deployment practices.
3. Manage your project's resources and permissions through Infrastructure as Code.
4. Monitor the health and performance of your application using GCP platform tools.

## Limitations

- Project Lifecycle: The Noble (Experimentation) service is not intended for long-term production workloads. Projects should aim to transition to full-scale production environments once they have completed the experimentation and learning phase.
- Compliance and Regulatory Requirements: Projects hosted in the Noble (Experimentation) service must adhere to the appropriate guidelines, policies, laws, and rules applicable to the Government of Canada.
