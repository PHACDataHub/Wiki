# Concept of Operations Document for Cloud Operations
> :warning: **This is a living document**:  
> This is subject to frequest updates as we are still in the early days of fleshing out how our operations will work.
> 
> In this early draft I will be using blockquote syntax to help wrestle with ideas and considerations.  In future drafts they will be removed where appropriate and their use will be the "proper" use of them.  For now I need certain things to stand out while putting things together.

> There may be sections below we don't need or don't make sense to us.  We can adjust/remove/rename as necessary.

## I. Introduction
### Purpose of the document
> :question: **Scoping of this should be restricted to GCP?**
>
> If we incorporate multiple CSPs it could get very messy.  There should be commonality of topics, but implementation and coverage can be different based on vendor stacks/services.
### Scope of the document
> See above block.  This all ties together.
### Overview of cloud operations
> :exclamation: I am struggling a bit to get a proper perspective on this header.

## II. Cloud Infrastructure
### Description of the cloud infrastructure
> :exclamation: We can likely pull some summary infor from GCP itself and then add reference links to appropriate official documentation instead of regurgitating a bunch of it here and having to unneeded maintenance to keep it aligned with the official description...
### Overview of the cloud provider's infrastructure
> See above?
### Overview of the cloud provider's security features
> See above?  Michael may have a series of links that may save us time to get this section figured out.
### Overview of the cloud provider's availability features
> Ask Michael about this one as well??????

## III. Cloud Services
> :question: The context of this whole section might need to be re-thought?
> 
> Should this be from the GCP perspective?  I suppose we should document certain aspects of GCP, but if CCCS has already vetted them, then how deep do we need to go into describing the vendor for our ConOps?
### Description of the cloud services being used
> :question: Can we even tailor this?  GCP has so many services... can we identify upfront beyond a few core services? i.e. GKE??

> :exclamation: Something like Istio isn't really a service offering (is it? @Michael's input here?), but will be needed to meet security controls in some scenarios.
### Overview of the cloud provider's service level agreements (SLAs)
> See above.  We should link to GCP SLAs if appropriate, but we should also decide what SLAs we will have for our own PHAC clients.
> :question: Should this be a link to a separate SLA document?  My answer is yes.
### Overview of the cloud provider's support services
> :question:  Overview here, link to expansive document here?
### Overview of the cloud provider's billing services
> :question: This is a good one. I am in the camp that eventually the business entity that "owns" a GCP project should get their own billing ID and become directly responsible for their burn-rate.  I am not sure this is a view shared by everyone.
