# Concept of Operations Document for Cloud Operations
> :warning: **This is a living document**:  
> This is subject to frequent updates as we are still in the early days of fleshing out how our operations will work.
> 
> In this early draft I will be using blockquote syntax to help wrestle with ideas and considerations.  In future drafts they will be removed where appropriate and their use will be the "proper" use of them.  For now I need certain things to stand out while putting things together.

> :warning: **ChatGPT+ generated this outline**
>
> There may be sections below we don't need or don't make sense to us.  We can adjust/remove/rename as necessary.

## I. Introduction
### Purpose of the document
> :question: **Scoping of this should be restricted to GCP?**
>
> If we incorporate multiple CSPs it could get very messy.  There should be commonality of topics, but implementation and coverage can be different based on vendor stacks/services.
### Scope of the document
> See above block.  This all ties together.
### Overview of cloud operations
> :exclamation: I am struggling a bit to get a proper perspective on this header.

## II. Cloud Infrastructure
### Description of the cloud infrastructure
> :exclamation: We can likely pull some summary infor from GCP itself and then add reference links to appropriate official documentation instead of regurgitating a bunch of it here and having to unneeded maintenance to keep it aligned with the official description...
### Overview of the cloud provider's infrastructure
> See above?
### Overview of the cloud provider's security features
> See above?  Michael may have a series of links that may save us time to get this section figured out.
### Overview of the cloud provider's availability features
> Ask Michael about this one as well??????

## III. Cloud Services
> :question: The context of this whole section might need to be re-thought?
> 
> Should this be from the GCP perspective?  I suppose we should document certain aspects of GCP, but if CCCS has already vetted them, then how deep do we need to go into describing the vendor for our ConOps?
### Description of the cloud services being used
> :question: Can we even tailor this?  GCP has so many services... can we identify upfront beyond a few core services? i.e. GKE??

> :exclamation: Something like Istio isn't really a service offering (is it? @Michael's input here?), but will be needed to meet security controls in some scenarios.
### Overview of the cloud provider's service level agreements (SLAs)
> See above.  We should link to GCP SLAs if appropriate, but we should also decide what SLAs we will have for our own PHAC clients.
> :question: Should this be a link to a separate SLA document?  My answer is yes.
### Overview of the cloud provider's support services
> :question:  Overview here, link to expansive document here?
### Overview of the cloud provider's billing services
> :question: This is a good one. I am in the camp that eventually the business entity that "owns" a GCP project should get their own billing ID and become directly responsible for their burn-rate.  I am not sure this is a view shared by everyone.

## IV. Cloud Operations Team
### Description of the cloud operations team
> :question: Should this be focussed on cloud infra?  I.e. John and Keith (at the moment??)  If yes, where do we document the overall team and its interfacing points?
> :question: Given the above question, does each sub-team in DE/DSCO/CIPHI (pick and acronym please!) have a sort-of conops?  Dev conops, business/BA conops and they are linked by an larger document?  How far down a rabbit-hole do we want to go?
### Roles and responsibilities of the cloud operations team
> The answer to this can/will be driven by the above questions.
> 
> :exclamation: John, Michael and Keith should be able to drive some answers into this section at the very least from what we are seeing from an infrastructure lens.
### Overview of the cloud operations team's communication channels
> :exclamation: John has already started driving this forward with the creation of some Slack-based support channels. 
> 
> @TODO John can add some depth here.  I think he may have already created some Wiki pages to help describe a support vision.
### Overview of the cloud operations team's escalation procedures
> :exclamation: :question:  This is a really good question.  Do we escalate directly to Google for things, or are we required to proxy everything via HC?
>
> :question: **Do we have our own support vehicle with GCP?**

## V. Cloud Operations Processes
### Overview of the cloud operations processes
> Initial guesswork processes have been drawn up for the technical side.  They are not final by any means.
>
> :exclamation: @TODO Keith: add diagrams into the wiki repo and link them here. Add numbers to each box in the diagram to allow linking of a box in the diagram to notes here where appropriate.
> :exclamation: We should document things like "HC has responsiblity for creating accounts" in this section?  It certainly is accounted for in the swimlane process diagram.

### Incident management process
> This is an interesting topic. What happens if a client is behaving badly (i.e. potentially breaks PBMM boundaries).  How should this be handled?  Is this even the correct section for this specific question?  Other types of incidents?
### Change management process
> We should document our change management here (i.e. driven through IaD, etc.) as Michael has tried to pitch it - "automation _*is*_ the change management process".  This will have to be clearly mapped out to explain how our intended automations will satisfy any thresholds PHAC may have for a standard CMP.
### Capacity planning process
> :question: Is this section even relevant?  Would we view this notionally more in terms of billing than actual cloud-capacity limits?
### Disaster recovery and business continuity process
> :exclamation: :warning:  I am interested in Michael's perspective on this.  Given how he is advocating for a containerized world and essentially required use of version control.  What does BCP look like through that lens?

## VI. Cloud Operations Tools
### Description of the cloud operations tools
> We need to get a clearer implemenation/realization of our actual operations infrastructure to really move this forward.
### Monitoring and alerting tools
> This can be sliced multiple ways - billing, security (what else?).
### Log management and analysis tools
> See above
### Configuration management tools
> There is a linkage here between our processes and our tools.
### Automation and orchestration tools
> See above

## VII. Cloud Security
> :exclamation:  I really would like Michael to have a strong voice in this one for obvious reasons.  I think it might be better to attempt to fill this one out in conjunction with Michael, or have him take a swing first.  My instinct tells me that although it will be slower, filling it in while talking and bouncing ideas around might ultimately be better.
### Overview of cloud security
> See above
### Description of the cloud security controls
> See above
### Access management and control
> See above
### Network security and firewall management
> See above
### Vulnerability management and penetration testing
> See above
### Disaster recovery and business continuity planning
> See above

## VIII. Conclusion
### Summary of the document
> Nothing to see here yet.
### Next steps
> Is this needed?
### Contact information for the cloud operations team.
> John's new Slack support channels go here?  Is there a group email box for this cloud-infra stuff?  Should we avoid one?
