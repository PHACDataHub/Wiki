Subject: Welcome to the Innovation Sandbox

Dear [Name],

Welcome to the Public Health Data Center of Practice (PDCP) Innovation Sandbox! We are excited to have you on board and look forward to working together to achieve your public health data projects.

Before we get started, we wanted to outline the terms and conditions for using the PDCP's Innovation Sandbox. As a sandbox environment, it is important to keep in mind the following:

- The Innovation Sandbox is a dev/test environment and not meant for production workloads.
- Please use only unclassified data.
- Please ensure you know the privacy level of your data before uploading.
- Please note that the only backup and recovery services available are the ones you implement yourself.
- Clients can be removed or services stopped at any time.
- Please do not break any rules or policies, legal or GC related.
- Virtual machines will automatically be shut down after hours to save money.

Please be aware of the following as you develop your innovation:

- Be aware of the one-time and monthly costs of the resources you will be deploying within your subscription.
- Ensure you are building secure resources within your subscription.
- Turn off machines when you do not require them to save money.

We want to make sure that you have all the tools you need to enable alerts, view logs, and enhance your security posture. Please let us know if you need any assistance or have any questions.

Thank you for joining our community of innovators, and we look forward to seeing the amazing things you create in the PDCP Innovation Sandbox.

Best regards,
