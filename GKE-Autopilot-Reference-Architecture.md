This reference architecture provides an overview of GKE Autopilot and outlines best practices for implementing and managing GKE Autopilot clusters in the context of the Public Health Agency of Canada's cloud infrastructure.
# **Architecture Overview**
GKE Autopilot automates the management of Kubernetes clusters, handling tasks such as provisioning, scaling, and upgrading nodes. It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, allowing cloud experts at the Public Health Agency of Canada to focus on deploying and managing containerized applications. The high-level architecture of a GKE Autopilot cluster consists of the following components:
## Control Plane
The Kubernetes control plane is responsible for managing the overall state of the cluster, including API server, etcd datastore, and other control components. In GKE Autopilot, the control plane is fully managed by Google Cloud.
## Worker Nodes
GKE Autopilot provisions and manages the worker nodes, which run containerized applications. Nodes are grouped into regional or zonal node pools, with each node running a predefined set of components, such as container runtime and kubelet.
## Networking
GKE Autopilot utilizes VPC-native clusters, which provide native support for Google Cloud networking features, such as Alias IP ranges and Shared VPC.
## Storage
Persistent storage for containerized applications can be provisioned using Google Cloud Persistent Disks, which can be automatically created and managed through Kubernetes Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims.
## Multi-Cluster Design
To reduce dependency on shared infrastructure and increase fault tolerance, it's recommended to create multiple GKE Autopilot clusters, each serving a specific purpose or application workload. This approach provides better isolation between workloads and allows for independent scaling and management.
# **Key Components and Services**
The following components and services play a critical role in a GKE Autopilot implementation:
## Kubernetes
GKE Autopilot is built on Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform. Kubernetes provides the core functionality for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.
## Container Registry
Google Cloud Container Registry is a private container registry that stores and manages container images. It integrates with GKE Autopilot, allowing you to easily deploy container images stored in the registry to your clusters.

# **Implementation Best Practices**
To ensure a successful implementation of GKE Autopilot for the Public Health Agency of Canada, follow these best practices:
## Cluster Design
Consider creating a separate cluster for each application to reduce dependency on shared infrastructure, improve fault tolerance, and enable better isolation between workloads. With this approach, the Public Health Agency of Canada can:

- Minimize the risk of issues propagating across environments by isolating development, staging, and production workloads in separate clusters.
- Increase fault tolerance by reducing the blast radius of potential infrastructure failures and ensuring that an issue in one cluster does not affect other applications.
- Improve resource utilization and management by allowing each cluster to scale independently according to the needs of the specific application it serves.
- Enhance security by isolating sensitive workloads and enabling more fine-grained access control within each cluster.

When choosing between a multi-cluster design or a cluster per application, consider factors such as application requirements, resource usage patterns, and management overhead. Additionally, use regional clusters to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Regional clusters distribute nodes across multiple zones within a region, reducing the risk of zone-level failures impacting your applications.
## Networking
Use VPC-native clusters and configure appropriate network policies to secure and isolate your workloads. Leverage Google Cloud's networking features, such as Shared VPC and Cloud NAT, to simplify network management and improve security.
## Security
Enable features such as Shielded GKE Nodes and Workload Identity to enhance the security of your clusters. Implement Kubernetes RBAC for access control and use Google Cloud's Managed SSL Certificates for secure communication.
## Storage
Use Kubernetes Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims to provision and manage storage for your containerized applications.
