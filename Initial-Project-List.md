# Public Health Data Center of Practice Key Projects

## Overview
The Public Health Data Center of Practice is committed to improving public health outcomes through the collection, analysis, and sharing of health data. To achieve this, we have identified the following key projects:

### [PDCP-GOV-001] Governance Secretariat
#### Project Description
The Governance Secretariat project will establish a governance framework to guide data system changes, support the operations of the Technology Advisory Council, and integrate with the HC-PHAC Architecture Review Board. This framework will ensure that the use of data is aligned with public health objectives and that the right policies and procedures are in place to protect privacy, confidentiality, and security.

#### High-Level Deliverables
- Development of governance policies and procedures
- Establishment of a governance framework to guide data system changes
- Integration of governance framework with Technology Advisory Council and HC-PHAC Architecture Review Board

#### Relevance to Public Health Association of Canada
This project satisfies the PHAC objective of promoting a robust public health system by ensuring that data is collected, analyzed, and shared in a way that is consistent with public health objectives and protects individual privacy.

### [PDCP-CLOUD-001] Cloud Adoption Framework
#### Project Description
The Cloud Adoption Framework project will develop a framework to guide the implementation of cloud-based technologies in a way that aligns with technology policies and standards and enables interoperability of data. This framework will ensure that the use of cloud technologies is aligned with public health objectives and that data can be shared across different systems.

#### High-Level Deliverables
- Development of a cloud adoption framework
- Implementation of cloud-based technologies in a way that aligns with technology policies and standards
- Interoperability of data across different systems

#### Relevance to Public Health Association of Canada
This project satisfies the PHAC objective of promoting a robust public health system by enabling the interoperability of data across different systems and ensuring that the use of cloud technologies is aligned with public health objectives.

### [PDCP-INTEROP-001] Interoperability (API) Platform
#### Project Description
The Interoperability (API) Platform project will deploy an interoperability platform to enable connectivity of 35% of baseline surveillance systems by March 2024. This platform will allow for the seamless exchange of data across different systems and support the collection and analysis of data to inform public health decisions.

#### High-Level Deliverables
- Deployment of an interoperability (API) platform
- Connectivity of 35% of baseline surveillance systems
- Support for the collection and analysis of data to inform public health decisions

#### Relevance to Public Health Association of Canada
