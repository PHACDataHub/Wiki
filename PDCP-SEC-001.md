# Project [PDCP-SEC-001]

## Overview

Project [PDCP-SEC-001] is a foundational project for the Public Health Data Center of Practice that aims to implement a zero trust security architecture. The project will ensure that data is secure and protected in accordance with the highest security standards. It will also provide the foundation for future public health data projects to be developed in a secure and scalable environment.

The project will involve a significant organizational change around how IT security is done and IT security culture. The project team will work closely with government departments to ensure a smooth implementation.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To implement a zero trust security architecture for the Public Health Data Center of Practice.
- To ensure that data is secure and protected in accordance with the highest security standards.
- To provide a scalable and flexible environment for future public health data projects.

## Zero Trust Principles

Zero trust is a security framework that assumes all network traffic is untrusted and must be authenticated and authorized before it is allowed to access resources. Zero trust principles include:

- Verify explicitly: All access to resources must be authenticated and authorized, regardless of location.
- Principle of least privilege: Users and devices should only have access to the resources they need to perform their functions.
- Assume breach: The security posture should assume that all network traffic is untrusted and that attackers have already infiltrated the network.
- Never trust, always verify: Trust should not be automatically given to any device or user, and all access should be verified and authorized.

## GCP's Current Zero Trust Capabilities

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides a range of services and features that align with zero trust principles. These include:

- Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM provides centralized control over user and service accounts, as well as role-based access control.
- VPC Service Controls: VPC Service Controls allows users to define a security perimeter around their resources, controlling access to and from the internet and other cloud services.
- Security Key Enforcement: Security Key Enforcement enforces the use of security keys for multi-factor authentication, reducing the risk of account takeover.
- Istio: Istio is an open source service mesh that provides traffic management, security, and observability features, helping to enforce zero trust principles.

## Agile Roadmap

1. Sprint 0: Project Setup
- Define the project vision, goals, and objectives
- Identify the product owner, scrum master, and development team
- Create the project backlog and establish the sprint cadence

2. Sprint 1: Assessment and Planning
- Identify current security risks and potential attack vectors
- Determine the scope of the zero trust architecture implementation
- Develop a backlog of tasks to address the identified security risks

3. Sprint 2: Design and Build
- Prioritize tasks from the backlog and begin design and development
- Implement zero trust principles, such as identity and access management and micro-segmentation
- Configure security controls, such as VPC Service Controls and Security Key Enforcement
- Test and validate the implementation

4. Sprint 3: Deployment and Monitoring
- Deploy the zero trust architecture to production
- Monitor and manage the environment to ensure ongoing security and compliance
- Conduct regular security assessments to identify and mitigate new risks

5. Sprint 4: Continuous Improvement
- Collect and analyze feedback from users and stakeholders
- Identify areas for improvement and add them to the backlog
- Plan and execute iterations to improve the zero trust architecture
- Continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the security controls and adjust as necessary

## Challenges

The implementation of a zero trust security architecture will require a significant organizational change around how IT security is done and IT security culture. The project team will need to work closely with government departments to ensure a smooth implementation.

## Conclusion

Project [PDCP-SEC-001] is a critical project for the Public Health Data Center of Practice, providing a secure and scalable environment for future public health data projects. The agile approach will allow for flexibility and adaptability as the project progresses, ensuring that the zero trust architecture meets the needs of the organization and its users.
