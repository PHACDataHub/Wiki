# Overview

The **User Account Cleanup Process** is instituted to maintain the security and efficiency of our systems. This protocol offers clarity and structure to the process of managing inactive, unused, and departed user accounts, ensuring that only active users have access.

## How it Works

### Stages of Account Cleanup:

1. **90-Day Check**: 
    - Accounts that have been logged into, but not used for the last 90 days, are suspended.
    - Accounts that have never been logged in after 90 days from creation are deleted.

2. **120-Day Check**:
    - Accounts that remain suspended for an additional 30 days (totalling 120 days since last login) are deleted.
    
### Users Who Have Left:
- Accounts belonging to users who have officially left the organization will be immediately suspended.
- These accounts will follow the normal stages of account cleanup as detailed above.

### Procedure:

- **Prior Notification**: We notify the concerned stakeholders about the impending suspension a day in advance, allowing them to intervene if necessary.
- **Verification**: Before any action is executed, a report is run again to confirm the status of the accounts.

### Examples:

- An account last used on January 1 will be suspended on April 1 if not used during this period. If still inactive, it will be deleted on May 1.
- An account created on January 1 but never accessed will be deleted directly on April 1.
- An account belonging to a user who left the organization on January 1 will be suspended immediately and then will follow the normal cleanup stages.

## Benefits

Our **User Account Cleanup Protocol** offers several advantages:

- **Enhanced Security**: By regularly cleaning up inactive and departed user accounts, we minimize potential security risks.
- **Optimized Resources**: By ensuring only active users remain, we optimize system performance and resource allocation.

## Conclusion

The **User Account Cleanup Protocol** is crucial for maintaining the health, security, and efficiency of our systems. Through structured checks and safety measures, we ensure that our resources are used optimally, and data is always protected and accessible.
