# Support and Escalation Paths

At the Public Health Data Center of Practice (PDCP), we are committed to providing the best possible support to our stakeholders. If you require support or assistance with any of our services, please refer to the following channels:

- **Slack:** You can join our #cloud-support channel on Slack for real-time support during our support windows.
- **Email:** You can contact us at gcpops-pgcops@phac-aspc.gc.ca for support.

When you contact us for support, we follow an escalation path to ensure that your issue is addressed promptly and effectively. The escalation path is as follows:

1. **User Lead Research:** If you encounter an issue, we encourage you to research it on your own first. Try to identify the root cause of the issue and determine if there are any quick fixes or workarounds that you can implement.
2. **PDCP Embedded Lead:** If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, please reach out to the embedded PDCP lead in your team. They will be able to help troubleshoot the issue and escalate it further if necessary.
3. **PDCP Team Support:** If the issue cannot be resolved by the embedded lead, it will be escalated to the broader PDCP support team. Our support team will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
4. **PDCP GCP Admin:** If the issue is still not resolved, it will be escalated to the PDCP platform team for further investigation. The platform team will work with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) support team to resolve the issue.
5. **GCP SME:** If the issue cannot be resolved by the PDCP platform team, we may leverage Google or other professional services for additional support. This may involve leveraging paid support contracts or engaging GCP subject matter experts (SMEs) for assistance.

## Support Hours

The Public Health Data Center of Practice (PDCP) provides support during regular business hours, which are Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), excluding holidays observed by the Government of Canada. During these hours, we aim to respond to all support requests within one business day.

Please note that our support is limited to non-production environments and we do not provide 24/7 support. If you require support outside of our regular business hours, we will do our best to assist you during our next business hours.

In addition, we will make every effort to accommodate critical incidents or major service disruptions outside of regular business hours. However, please note that these incidents will be resolved on the next business day as we do not provide 24/7 support.

If you require support, please contact us by emailing gcpops-pgcops@phac-aspc.gc.ca or by using our #cloud-support channel on Slack during designated support windows. Our support windows are typically scheduled during peak usage hours to ensure that we can respond to urgent issues in a timely manner.

If you have any questions or concerns about our support hours or support process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us for clarification or guidance.
