## Description

There are three primary goals of this service offering:

- Provide epidemiologists with a familiar RStudio development environment, along with the ability to use as much or as little compute and storage as they require.

- Provide epidemiologists with the ability to securely deploy RShiny dashboards, along with the ability to control who has permission to view the contents of the dashboards.

- Dedicated and involved customer support from our IT staff. Getting started in a new cloud environment can be challenging, our staff can help as much or as little as is needed for your project to succeed on our environment.

## Features

- **Scalable Data Storage**: [Google Cloud Storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets) allow you to store as much data as you need.
- **Scalable Compute**: Choose from any of the supported [GCP available machine types](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/available-machine-types). At the time of writing, you can use as little as 1 vCPU and 4 GB memory or as much as 96 vCPU and 360 GB memory, depending on your requirements.
- **Authenticated RShiny Dashboard Hosting**: Host your RShiny dashboard behind a layer of authentication, verifying users' identities before they can access the dashboard.
