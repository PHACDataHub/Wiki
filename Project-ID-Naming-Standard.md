# Public Health Data Center of Practice Unique Project ID System

## Overview
The Public Health Data Center of Practice has implemented a unique project ID system to help manage and organize our key projects. This system is based on Google Cloud project tags, which allow us to easily categorize and filter projects based on their purpose, status, and other relevant factors.

## How it Works
Each project in our key project list is assigned a unique ID that follows a consistent format: PDCP-[CATEGORY]-[SEQUENCE]. Here's what each part of the ID represents:

- PDCP: This stands for Public Health Data Center of Practice and is included in all project IDs to clearly identify them as part of our organization.
- CATEGORY: This represents the category of the project and helps us group related projects together. For example, the category might be GOV for projects related to governance, CLOUD for projects related to cloud computing, or DATA for projects related to data management.
- SEQUENCE: This is a unique identifier for the project within its category. It is assigned sequentially as new projects are added to the list.

Here's an example of a project ID: PDCP-CLOUD-001. This ID indicates that the project is related to cloud computing and is the first project in that category.

## Benefits
Our unique project ID system provides several benefits:

- Consistent format: By following a consistent format for all project IDs, we can easily recognize and categorize projects based on their ID.
- Easy filtering: Google Cloud project tags allow us to filter projects based on their ID, which can help us quickly find and organize projects based on their category, status, or other relevant factors.
- Scalability: By assigning a unique ID to each project, we can easily add new projects to the list and ensure that they are properly categorized and organized.

## Conclusion
The unique project ID system implemented by the Public Health Data Center of Practice helps us manage and organize our key projects in a way that is consistent, scalable, and easy to navigate. By using this system, we can ensure that our projects are properly categorized and organized, which ultimately helps us achieve our goal of improving public health outcomes through the collection, analysis, and sharing of health data.
