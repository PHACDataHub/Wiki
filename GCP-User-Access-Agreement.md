# User Agreement for Accessing PHAC's GCP Resources

Hello!

By using our online resources, you agree to follow some rules to keep everything secure. This is important to protect our stuff and make sure everything runs smoothly.

## 1. What's This All About?
This is about using a special security key, called a YubiKey, and sometimes an app on your phone, to safely access our online spaces, like our Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## 2. Using Your YubiKey and Phone App:

- **YubiKey is Your Go-To:** We'll give you a YubiKey. It's a small device you use to prove it's really you when you sign in online. We want you to use it whenever you access our systems.
  
- **Phone App Backup:** If for some reason you can't use your YubiKey, you can also use an app on your phone as a backup method for proving it's you.

- **Avoid Text Messages or Emails for Signing In:** We really don't want you to use text messages or emails as a way to sign in because they're not as safe. In fact, we're planning to turn off these options soon to keep our info super secure.

## 3. Looking After Your YubiKey:

- **Your YubiKey, Your Responsibility:** It's important you keep your YubiKey safe. Don't give it to someone else, and be careful not to lose it. But don't worry, it's yours to keep, even if you leave the company later.

- **Uh-oh, Lost or Stolen?** If you lose your YubiKey or someone steals it, tell our IT team right away. They need to know so they can stop someone else from using your key to access our stuff.

## 4. Getting and Managing Your YubiKey:

- **Setting Up:** We'll show you how to get your YubiKey working with our systems. If you run into any trouble, just reach out to our IT folks for help.

- **No Need to Give It Back:** Your YubiKey is yours to keep. You can even use it to make your own personal accounts more secure!

## 5. Good Password Habits:
You still need to use strong passwords. Make them tricky and change them now and then to keep things extra safe.

## 6. If Your YubiKey Goes Missing:

- **Tell Us Fast:** If your YubiKey goes missing, tell us straight away! We'll jump into action to make sure no one sneaks into our systems.

- **What Happens Next:** We'll take steps to keep things secure, like resetting passwords or checking for any sneaky behavior on our network.

## 7. General Stuff:

- **Following Rules:** We have some general security rules you need to follow. If you don't, we might have to take serious steps, including limiting your access or letting you go.

- **Changes to These Rules:** Sometimes, we might need to change these rules. If we do, we'll make sure to tell you what's new.

- **Agreeing to These Terms:** By using your YubiKey and getting into our online spaces, you're saying "yes" to these rules. It's your promise to do your part in keeping our digital world safe.
