The [template repo](https://github.com/PHACDataHub/DSCO-template-repo) serves as a starting point repo including documentation and templates that we use as a standard. Only repo's that are created based off that template will have the starting point elements. Changes made to the template repo will only reflect and future repo's created based off of it. Old repo's will not see changes.

In order to roll out updates to repo's in the organization, we could alternatively use a ".github" repo. This repo is a special repo, elements such as templates can be accessed by any repo organization wide. Updates to templates will also be automatically be reflected in repos.
