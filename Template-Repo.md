The [template repo](https://github.com/PHACDataHub/DSCO-template-repo) serves as a starting point repo including documentation and templates that we use as a standard. Only repos that are created based off that template will have the starting point elements. Changes made to the template repo will only reflect on future repos created. Old repos will not see changes.

In order to roll out updates to repos in the organization, we could alternatively use a ".github" repo. This repo is a special repo, elements such as templates can be accessed by any repo organization wide. Updates to templates will also be automatically reflected in repos.
