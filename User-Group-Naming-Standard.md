**Overview**

The Google Cloud User Group Naming Standard is designed to help manage and organize user groups in a consistent and easily recognizable manner. This system is based on a consistent format that allows for easy categorization and filtering of user groups based on their purpose, associated project, and role.

**How it Works**

Rules:

1. All lower case
2. No dashes in the name of the project
3. expressed as pseudo-regex:
	* ph(d|t|p|x|o)-nametextnospaces_role
	* ph = public health
	* (d|t|p|x|o) THIS IS ONLY REQUIRED AT PROJECT LEVEL; DEFAULT TO ‘O’ IF ONLY 1 ENV
		* d = dev
		* t = test
		* p = prod
		* x = experimental
		* o = other

        * role
		* owner
		* editor
		* other

**Examples:**

* `php-diseaseprofiler_owner` for an owner group from the project called php-diseaseprofiler.
* `php-diseaseprofiler_editor` for an editor group from the project called php-diseaseprofiler.
* `php-diseaseprofiler_viewer` for a viewer group from the project called php-diseaseprofiler.


**Benefits**

Our Google Cloud user group naming standard provides several benefits:

1. Consistent format: By following a consistent format for all user group names, we can easily recognize and categorize user groups based on their name.
2. Easy filtering: Our user group naming system allows us to filter user groups based on their name, which can help us quickly find and organize user groups based on their role, associated project, or other relevant factors.
3. Scalability: By assigning a unique name to each user group, we can easily add new user groups to the list and ensure that they are properly categorized and organized.

**Conclusion**

The Google Cloud user group naming standard helps us manage and organize user groups in a way that is consistent, scalable, and easy to navigate. By using this system, we can ensure that our user groups are properly categorized and organized, which ultimately helps us achieve our goal of improving the management and organization of Google Cloud resources.
