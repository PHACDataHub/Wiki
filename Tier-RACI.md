# Introduction

As part of its commitment to providing high-quality cloud services to its users, the Public Health Data Center of Practice (CDP) has developed a Tiers of Service framework that defines the levels of service and support available to users based on their needs and requirements. 

To ensure effective communication and collaboration among all parties involved in the delivery of these services, the CDP has also established a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed) matrix that outlines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders at each tier of service. This matrix is designed to clarify expectations, facilitate decision-making, and ensure that everyone is working together towards the common goal of delivering reliable, secure, and responsive cloud services. 

This document provides an overview of the Tiers of Service and the associated RACI matrix, including the key roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder group. We encourage all users and stakeholders of the CDP to review and familiarize themselves with this information to ensure a smooth and successful engagement with the CDP cloud services.
