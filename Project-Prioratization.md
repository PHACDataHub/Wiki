### Steps for Project Prioritization Rubric

1. Define the criteria for prioritization: First, you need to define the criteria that you will use to assess each project. These criteria should be based on your agency's goals and objectives, as well as the specific needs of each project. For example, you may want to consider factors like the project's potential impact on public health, the feasibility of implementation, the cost and resource requirements, the level of stakeholder support, and the urgency of the need for the project.

2. Assign weights to each criterion: Once you have defined the criteria, you need to assign weights to each one based on their relative importance. For example, you may decide that impact on public health is the most important criterion and should be weighted more heavily than the other criteria.

3. Score each project on each criterion: Next, you need to score each project on each criterion. This can be done on a scale of 1 to 5 or any other scale that you prefer. Be sure to use consistent criteria and a consistent scale across all projects.

4. Calculate the total score for each project: To calculate the total score for each project, multiply the score for each criterion by its weight and add up the scores for all criteria.

5. Rank the projects by total score: Once you have calculated the total score for each project, you can rank them in order of priority. The project with the highest score should be the top priority, and the project with the lowest score should be the lowest priority.

6. Review and adjust the rubric: After using the rubric to prioritize the projects, you should review the results and adjust the rubric as necessary. This may involve revising the criteria, changing the weights assigned to each criterion,


### Selection Criteria

1. Potential impact on public health: This criterion assesses the potential benefits of the project in terms of improving the health of the public. Factors to consider may include the number of people who would be affected, the severity of the health issue being addressed, and the potential to reduce health disparities.

2. Feasibility of implementation: This criterion assesses the practicality of implementing the project. Factors to consider may include the availability of resources (e.g. funding, personnel, equipment), the level of technical expertise required, and the potential for community support.

3. Cost and resource requirements: This criterion assesses the financial and resource requirements of the project. Factors to consider may include the cost of materials and equipment, the cost of personnel, and the time and effort required for implementation.

4. Level of stakeholder support: This criterion assesses the level of support for the project among key stakeholders, such as community leaders, healthcare providers, and policymakers. Factors to consider may include the level of involvement of stakeholders in the project planning process, the degree of agreement on project goals, and the potential for collaboration and partnerships.

5. Urgency of the need for the project: This criterion assesses the level of urgency for the project. Factors to consider may include the severity and immediacy of the health issue being addressed, the potential for the issue to worsen over time, and the availability of alternative interventions.
