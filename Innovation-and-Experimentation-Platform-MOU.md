# Innovation and Experimentation Platform MOU

This Innovation and Experimentation Platform is a development/testing environment. It is not meant for production workloads. Please use unclassified data only, and ensure that you know the privacy level of your data before uploading.

The following rules apply to this environment:

- Only backup and recovery services you implement yourself are available.
- Clients can be removed or services stopped at any time.
- Do not break any rules or policies, legal or government-related.

All initiatives will be organized into an Innovation Sandbox that provides a space to build their applications. The Innovation Sandbox includes billing and alerts, base governance policies, health and security monitoring, and logging, and optionally networking.

We provide only a basic Innovation Sandbox to empower you. As you develop your innovation, please be aware of the following:

- The one-time and monthly costs of the resources you will be deploying within your workspace.
- Ensure you are building secure resources within your subscription.
- Turn off machines when you do not require them to save money.

Please note that this is currently a sandbox environment, and a production environment may be created in the future.

We encourage you to use the available tools to enable alerts, view logs, and enhance your security posture.
