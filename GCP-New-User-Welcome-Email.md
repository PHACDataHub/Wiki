**Subject: Welcome to PHAC GCP Cloud**

Hello [Name],

Welcome to PHAC GCP Cloud! We are delighted to have you join us and look forward to working together to [briefly mention the purpose or goals of the collaboration/project].

As part of the onboarding process, we have created an account for you on GCP, and we will be providing you with a hardware key for Multifactor Authentication (MFA) to enhance the security of your account.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. **Choose a Multifactor Authentication App**: When you first enable your account, please select a multifactor authentication app such as [List of recommended apps, e.g., Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator] from your device's app store. We strongly recommend against using SMS or email for authentication.

2. **YubiKey Issuance**: We will also issue you a YubiKey, which will become your primary MFA mechanism. To ensure a smooth process, we need the following information:

   - **Mailing Address**: Please provide us with your mailing address.
   - **Contact Phone Number**: A phone number where we can reach you.
   - **USB Type Preference**: Let us know if you prefer a YubiKey with a USB-A or USB-C connector.
