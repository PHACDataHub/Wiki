## Enhance Your Experimentation Experience with Two Simple VM Steps!

Dear Experimentation Service User,

As our Google Cloud Infrastructure continues to evolve, our engagement with you is set to increase. We're passionate about ensuring you have the optimal environment for innovation. To further streamline the Experimentation service experience, we've outlined two recommended actions for VM users:

### 1. Schedule Your VM Instances  
For those who can accommodate their VMs shutting down periodically, setting a schedule not only promotes resource efficiency and cost savings but also ensures we're being financially wise and ecologically friendly. Idling VMs inadvertently contribute to unnecessary expenditures and energy consumption.
- **Guide:** Utilize Google's official guide on [scheduling VM instance start and stop in GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/schedule-instance-start-stop?authuser=1#console).

### 2. Limit VM Runtimes  
By designating runtime boundaries, you can prevent extended, unintended resource consumption.
- **Guide:** Familiarize yourself with [how to limit VM runtime via Google's instructions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/limit-vm-runtime?authuser=1).

### 3. Migrate Away from VMs  
Consider the potential of replacing a VM with a containerized solution. Containers offer a lightweight, scalable, and versatile alternative to traditional VMs, allowing for optimized resource utilization. For an in-depth understanding of containers and how they can benefit your workloads, explore Google Cloud's guide:
- **Guide:** Check out [What are Containers?](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-are-containers?authuser=1) by Google Cloud to grasp the concept and advantages of containerization.



> **Note:** If your experimentation requires VMs to remain constantly active, please feel free to continue as you are. We recognize and appreciate the diverse VM usage patterns within our community.

### Recommended Settings for VMs

To align with our suggested best practices and enhance resource efficiency, we recommend the following settings for your VMs:

1. **Scheduled VM Shutdown:**  
   - Set your VMs to automatically shut down at **6pm EST** every day. This ensures we maximize usage during core hours and minimize waste during off-hours.
   
2. **Auto Shutdown Duration:**  
   - Configure your VMs to automatically shut down after **4 hours** of inactivity. This helps in conserving resources and avoiding extended, unintentional VM runtimes.

Applying these settings will aid in ensuring both cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness. For step-by-step guidance on how to implement these settings, please refer to the provided guides above.


### Need Assistance?  
We're here to help! If you have questions, require guidance, or need someone to walk you through the VM optimization steps, please reach out to our dedicated team through our [Cloud Support page](https://github.com/PHACDataHub/Wiki/wiki/Cloud-Support).

Your ongoing partnership and commitment to our shared experimentation platform are invaluable. As we move forward, anticipate even closer collaboration.
