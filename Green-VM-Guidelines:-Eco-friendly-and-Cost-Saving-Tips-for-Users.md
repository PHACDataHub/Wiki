## Enhance Your Experimentation Experience with Two Simple VM Steps!

Dear Experimentation Service User,

As our Google Cloud Infrastructure continues to evolve, our engagement with you is set to increase. We're passionate about ensuring you have the optimal environment for innovation. To further streamline the Experimentation service experience, we've outlined two recommended actions for VM users:

### 1. Schedule Your VM Instances  
For those who can accommodate their VMs shutting down periodically, setting a schedule not only promotes resource efficiency and cost savings but also ensures we're being financially wise and ecologically friendly. Idling VMs inadvertently contribute to unnecessary expenditures and energy consumption.
- **Guide:** Utilize Google's official guide on [scheduling VM instance start and stop in GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/schedule-instance-start-stop?authuser=1#console).

### 2. Limit VM Runtimes  
By designating runtime boundaries, you can prevent extended, unintended resource consumption.
- **Guide:** Familiarize yourself with [how to limit VM runtime via Google's instructions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/limit-vm-runtime?authuser=1).

> **Note:** If your experimentation requires VMs to remain constantly active, please feel free to continue as you are. We recognize and appreciate the diverse VM usage patterns within our community.

To delve deeper into our evolving Experimentation service and understand these VM recommendations, please visit our [Experimentation Offering Wiki](https://github.com/PHACDataHub/Wiki/wiki/Experimentation-Offering).

### Need Assistance?  
We're here to help! If you have questions, require guidance, or need someone to walk you through the VM optimization steps, please reach out to our dedicated team through our [Cloud Support page](https://github.com/PHACDataHub/Wiki/wiki/Cloud-Support).

Your ongoing partnership and commitment to our shared experimentation platform are invaluable. As we move forward, anticipate even closer collaboration.

Warm regards,

[Your Name/Your Team's Name]
