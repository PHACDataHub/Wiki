Subject: Welcome to the Experimentation Sandbox

Dear [Name],

Welcome to the Center of Practice(COP) Experimentation Sandbox! We are excited to have you on board and look forward to working together to achieve your public health data goals. As part of the accelerated on-boarding process we have opted to deploy a GCP project with a small $2000 budget on your behalf. As a follow up to this email/message, someone from the team will do an initial engagement to ensure what has been deployed fits your needs and to also capture business information that our own group will need for tracking. 

Before we get started, we wanted to outline the terms and conditions for using the COP Experimentation Sandbox. As a sandbox environment, it is important to keep in mind the following:

- The Experimentation Sandbox is a test environment and not meant for production workloads.
- Please use only unclassified data.
- Please ensure you know the privacy level of your data before uploading.
- Please note that the only backup and recovery services available are the ones you implement yourself.
- Clients can be removed or services stopped at any time.
- Please do not break any rules or policies, legal or GC related.
- Virtual machines should automatically be shut down after hours to save money.

Please be aware of the following as you develop:

- Be aware of the one-time and monthly costs of the resources you will be deploying within your subscription.
- Ensure you are building secure resources within your subscription, Read and understand the [[COP-Security-Policy]].
- Turn off machines when you do not require them to save money.

We want to make sure that you have all the tools you need to enable alerts, view logs, and enhance your security posture. Please let us know if you need any assistance or have any questions.

Thank you for joining our community of innovators, and we look forward to seeing the amazing things you create in the COP Experimentation Sandbox.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
