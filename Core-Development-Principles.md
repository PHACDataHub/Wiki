# Appendix DMIA Development Principles
## Design systems as highly modular and loosely coupled services.
Create flexible, independent components that can be easily combined, replaced, or updated, promoting adaptability and maintainability across the entire system.
## Design systems' components with smallest blast radius in mind
Minimize the potential impact of failures by isolating and containing issues, ensuring that a single component's failure won't lead to widespread system disruption.
## Build to support zero-downtime deployments
Implement strategies such as rolling updates, blue-green deployments, or canary releases to minimize disruption and downtime during application updates and maintenance.
## Use distributed architectures
Leverage multiple nodes or clusters across different geographical locations to enhance resilience, fault tolerance, and availability of the system.
## Expose services, including existing ones, through APIs
Facilitate seamless integration and interoperability between services by using well-defined, standardized APIs, enabling easy communication and data exchange.
## Ensure automated testing is possible through good design
Develop systems that support test automation, ensuring robustness, reliability, and faster feedback cycles during development and deployment.
## Design for cloud mobility
Create portable and cloud-agnostic solutions, making it easier to migrate applications and services across different cloud providers or on-premise environments if needed.
## Prioritize open source
Opt for open-source technologies and platforms that offer flexibility, community support, and lower costs while encouraging collaboration and innovation.
## Enforce service models in order of preference: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
SaaS, PaaS, IaaS: Prioritize cloud services that offer the highest level of abstraction and management, reducing operational overhead and simplifying deployment.
## Create reusable components that support accessibility
Develop modular, accessible components that can be easily reused across different projects, ensuring consistent user experiences and reducing development time.
## Prioritize function over form without losing sight of elegance
Focus on building practical, efficient solutions that fulfill their purpose while maintaining a clean, user-friendly design.
## Zero trust all the things -- assume breach perspective
Implement a security approach that assumes no trust by default, requiring continuous authentication and authorization for all users, devices, and services, minimizing the potential impact of security breaches.
