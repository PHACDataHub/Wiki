There are a few things that happen at the organization level only. 
Access to the org level is needed for a few tasks:

* Account Provisioning: Service hours and turnaround time are open questions in the absence of self serve. 
* Auditing of user accounts: don't know who does and doesn’t have an account 
* Can't verify user ID's: Guessing user account ID’s 
* Cant change user emails: manual task that needs to be done for each user 
* Account resets:
* Visibility across projects: Can Security Command Centre operate at the folder level? Or are we choosing between project and org?
