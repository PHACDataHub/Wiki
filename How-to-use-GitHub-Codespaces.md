# How to utilize GitHub Codespaces
## What is GitHub Codespaces? 
(Generated by ChatGPT)

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows developers to write, run, and debug code entirely within their web browser. Essentially, it enables developers to create and customize a development environment that is hosted entirely on GitHub.

Codespaces provides developers with a complete and familiar development environment, including code editors, extensions, and debugging tools. This means that developers can easily switch between working on different projects and environments without having to set up their own local development environment.

With GitHub Codespaces, developers can quickly spin up a new development environment, test their code, and collaborate with other developers in real-time. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with GitHub's existing tools, such as GitHub Actions, and enables developers to easily set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines for their projects.

Overall, GitHub Codespaces is an innovative solution that can save developers time and improve collaboration, enabling them to focus on writing great code rather than setting up and maintaining their development environment.

## What are the constraints?
GitHub Codespaces provides each account with **15 GB monthly storage** and **120 core hours usage per month** for free.
That being said, use the provided resources efficiently to avoid running out before the month resets.

A stable and reliable internet connection is also required at all times as this is a cloud-based environment.

## Getting Started

1. Head to the repository you wish to work on.

2. Once you are on the page of the repository, look for the blue button labeled '<> Code'

4. You will then find yourself in a browser version of VSCode.

5. At this point you may use the terminal to 'npm install' your packages and run your application or edit the codebase in the explorer.

## Configuration

You may configure preferences to your liking by accessing the [settings](https://github.com/settings/codespaces). In this section, you can set timeout limits for your codespace which can help save you usage hours while not actively working on your codespace. You can also choose a different web editor instead of VSCode.
