The Public Health Data Center of Practice offers several intake processes to help ensure that your project or request is aligned with our services and resources.

The Directed intake process is for situations where there is a directive from leadership or management to undertake a specific action. This intake process is for situations where there is a clear mandate to execute a particular project or initiative, and the request needs to be actioned immediately. Directed requests are typically handled on a case-by-case basis, and may involve expedited processing and dedicated resources to ensure timely completion.

The Lead Conversion intake process is designed for our embedded staff who have identified potential new business opportunities that align with our services and resources. This intake process empowers our staff to bring new projects to our attention and follow a streamlined process for onboarding them. We trust our staff's good judgment and expertise to identify opportunities that are a good fit for our organization, and we value their input in identifying potential new projects or initiatives. Lead Conversion requests are typically handled by a member of our coaching and mentoring team, and may involve dedicated resources to ensure a smooth and efficient onboarding process. This intake process is primarily geared towards small initiatives and experiments that align with our organization's strategic objectives.

The Service Catalog (Small Request) intake process is for requests that require a small amount of resources or services, and are available through the service catalog. This intake process is for situations where the requestor has identified a specific service or resource they need from our catalog, and can provide a clear description of their requirements. Service Catalog (Small Request) requests are typically handled by an intake team.

## 4. Service Catalog (Large Request)

The Service Catalog (Large Request) intake process is for requests that require a large amount of resources or services, and are available through our service catalog. This intake process is for situations where the requestor has identified a specific service or resource they need from the catalog, but the request requires a more detailed analysis or consultation before implementation. Service Catalog (Large Request) requests are typically handled by our intake team, with support from a solutions architect or technical lead.

## 5. Organizationally Strategy

The Organizationally Strategy intake process is designed for larger initiatives and projects that are identified by the organization or the CIO as planned activities for the yearly strategic plan. This intake process is intended for situations where strategic planning and consultation are necessary before implementation, and may involve a detailed analysis of business requirements, technical architecture, and project planning. Our solutions architecture or project management teams, with support from technical leads and business analysts, typically handle Organizationally Strategy requests. This intake process is focused on projects that have a significant impact on the organization's strategic objectives and may require dedicated resources and extended timelines to ensure successful implementation. By following this intake process, we ensure that projects are aligned with our organization's strategic objectives and are executed with careful planning and consideration.
