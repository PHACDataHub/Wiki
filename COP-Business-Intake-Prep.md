# Introduction
Preparing for the business intake process is an important step in ensuring a successful project. As part of this process, we will be gathering information about the technical resources and requirements for your project. While this checklist provides a starting point, we will be gathering more detailed information throughout the intake submission process. It's important to note that this checklist is not a document we will be using for the project documents, and we will not be tracking the details or requiring it to be filled out. Instead, it is meant to guide your thinking and ensure that we have a clear understanding of the technical requirements for your project.
