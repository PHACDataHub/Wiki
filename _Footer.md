 **Under Development**
* This wiki and the documents being developed under it are living documents.
* They are all pre-decisional.
* Some of these documents were generated using chatGPT or were developed by other organizations for reuse and adaptation. 
* **Some of the documents in this wiki are in early early drafts, they make reference to things that do no exist or to process not yet being used.**
* The Center of practice(COP) is best effort and will be developed iteratively. This includes the technology supporting the COP
* At the early stages of the COP expect change; short life cycles and rapid changes. Plan accordingly. 
* Stability in the COP will materialize over time.
* For immediate reference engage your COP support channel, use the documentation as a secondary source.
* There is reference to the COP and PDCP in the documentation, these are the same entity. We haven't picked a name yet :) 


*All of the pages in this wiki should be considered draft, underdevelopment and needing review. 
None of these pages are official documentation. 
All of the pages are a work in progress and discussion is encouraged via the GitHub issues mechanism.*
